different cities that they visit. With their original $1000.00 they have to strategically plan on
which shares of which cities to buy in order to earn money. The point of this game is to allow me to
test different types of economic models for online games on a real audience. Currently the economy has
a set amount of wealth in it and the game allows multiple players to compete for a share of that wealth.</p>

After the web crawler discovers the images they are placed in a download queue and displayed to the user as they are downloaded.</p>

PanicOS Currently features a working GDT and IDT table setup. IRQ's and ISRS's are working. Protected mode is enabled. A simple keyboard and serial driver are working. A simple shell is functioning. A simple memory managment system is in place. Paging is enabled. An Initial Ramdisk is setup and working (filesystems yay!). Basic multitasking is started. IE fork() works, but execv() does not yet.</p>

                                <p class="summary">Explorer was a hackathon attempt to emulate a turn by turn rogue like survival web game. It went pretty well, but it is pretty hard to naturally figure out how to survive. Explorer was an exercise in NOT PLANNING AHEAD. I didn't arcitect anything in this program and just let it grow naturally over the course of an evening. As a result it has pretty ugly code, but it's good to learn from.</p>

                                <p class="summary">In Evolution I aimed to create creatures in a simulated world. These creatures have brains. They are able to both Sexually and Asexually reproduce. Their brains will eveolve using a custom designed genetic algorithm. The evolution of the brains was found to cause the creatures to become more fit in their virtual world. They are able to avoid predators, find mates, live longer and reproduce. After running the Evolution program for some time we can save the brains of our creatures and have them compete against other creatures.</p>

					I was slightly ahead of Isaac's cohort during our time at HSU.  
					First, I have never met another student that was even close to Isaac's level. 
					I've never seen a student be competent enough to stand toe-to-toe with a professor before. 
					Isaac easily outclassed every professor with whom we shared a class.  
					I was super falling behind my work, thinking about dropping out even. I was stressed.  
					Isaac held my hand for months getting me caught back up. 
					He was able to help me become an expert in a subject that I felt very unsure about previously. 
					He helped me pass classes HE HADN'T even taken yet! He already knew EVERYTHING from the class. 
					I don't know how he does it. 
					Isaac was so sweet, he gave and gave and gave and never asked anything back. 
					Except, of course, for having me write this for his website :)</p>

					I noticed after a couple classes that this guy is ahead of the game

					I admire the way his brain works and he not only helped me understand the concepts better, 
					but we also teamed up for helping me with my beginner computer programming class homework. 
					<br />
					<br />
					The biggest takeaway from Isaac is that he encouraged me to have my own opinion and 
					thought about anything the teacher, or another student, shows me. 
					Which basically means, leaning things on my own, which is part of the big picture of 
					college. I admired that he would calmly disagree with the teacher, and he was 
					usually right after they worked through it. After working with him, I gained 
					confidence on the fact that I can do this really hard subject and figure things 
					out on my own. Or I can always email Isaac for emergency help! :)</p>

Isaac Stepped in and volunteered to tutor me every Monday and Thursday for 2-3 hours each session. Isaac taught me the basics of computer programming all the way up to the complicated stuff! It's my dream to become a game designer someday. I thought that may never happen until Isaac stepped in and turned everything around for me.</p>

I started taking Calculus and I was completely lost. Isaac offered to help me after class (for free). We worked for several hours after class multiple times a week for an entire semester. I passed the class with an B instead of an F. I attribute that completely to all the hard work he did with me. I thought I was dumb as a rock, be he's soooo good at explaining things.
